```javascript
//pages/index.js
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my Next.js app!</h1>
      <Link href='/about'>
        <a>Go to About page</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```
```javascript
//pages/about.js

export default function About() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>This is the About page</h1>
      <p>This is some content for the about page.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
The bug in this case is likely caused by a problem outside the scope of this code snippet; the code provided is perfectly valid and functional Next.js.  The error is likely due to an issue with the development environment (caching, server restarts, etc.) or a conflict with another library.
Potential solutions involve:
* **Clearing the browser cache and restarting the development server.** This often resolves intermittent issues related to caching.
* **Ensuring correct Next.js configuration:** Verify the Next.js configuration files (`next.config.js`, etc.) are correctly set up.
* **Checking for conflicting libraries:** Check for any conflicts or compatibility issues between Next.js and other libraries included in the project.
* **Inspecting server logs:** Examine the server logs for any errors or warnings that could indicate the root cause of the issue.
