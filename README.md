# Next.js Intermittent 404 Error Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Next.js application where navigation to certain pages intermittently results in a 404 error, even though the pages exist in the `pages` directory. The bug is intermittent and not easily reproducible.

## Bug Description

When navigating to pages other than the index page (`/`), the app sometimes returns a 404 error instead of rendering the correct page content. This error occurs despite the target page existing in the `pages` directory and appearing to be correctly configured.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the `/about` page (or any other page other than the index page).
5. Observe that the page might render correctly, or it might return a 404 error intermittently.

## Expected Behavior

Navigating to any page defined within the `pages` directory should consistently render the page's content without encountering a 404 error.

## Actual Behavior

Intermittently, navigating to pages other than the index page results in a 404 error.

## Workaround

The provided solution file (`bugSolution.js`) offers a potential workaround by ensuring Next.js correctly handles the routing and page loading process. This might involve verifying the Next.js configuration, inspecting for potential conflicts with other libraries, or examining the server logs for further insights. A clean rebuild of the Next.js app also might be helpful.
